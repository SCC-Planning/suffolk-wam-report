# suffolk-wam-report

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of suffolk-wam-report is to provide a reproducible way to
generate the Suffolk Waste Annual Monitoring Report automatically each
year. This report is required to be submitted to central government
every December(?).

All plots and tables have been styled to be consistent with the Suffolk
County Councilâ€™s brand.

Do note that while this is a nice template for the standard sections of
the report. Year-on-year changes will demand some more in-depth
investigation. For example, in 20/21 a deeper dive into sewage sludge.
