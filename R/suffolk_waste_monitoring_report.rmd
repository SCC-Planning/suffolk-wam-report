# Introduction

The Suffolk Minerals & Waste Local Plan was adopted in July 2020.
The Plan contains a Vision explaining how the County will meet its statutory obligation for the supply of aggregates and the sustainable management of waste.
It contains policies for determining planning application for minerals and waste development and identifies sites for future development for these uses.

It is important to understand whether the policies in the Plan are being delivered as intended and the extent to which the waste arisings and movements that were forecast are correct.
Because of the nature of waste data, such forecasts will never be exact, but trends can be identified and broad conclusions reached.

The Plan identifies sites that are suitable for the management of waste and this Monitoring Report will examine whether such sites have been taken forward for this use, or whether the policies should be amended in a future Plan.

The Local Plan contains a Policy Monitoring Framework which identifies the Performance Indicators that will be used to monitor the Plan which are the number of times that the relevant policies are triggered in the decision-making process.

Suffolk County Council also has a Development Management Local Monitoring and Enforcement Plan, adopted in 2016.
This sets out how the Council deals with the monitoring of developments as they are delivered including site visits to ensure that planning conditions are being carried out as intended.

This report looks at the effectiveness of the waste policies in delivering the policy outcomes in the Plan.
In particular it examines whether Suffolk is net self-sufficient in the management of the waste arising with the Plan Area or whether additional waste management facilities are required to achieve this.

# Methodology

The [Waste Data Interrogator 2019](https://find-data-beta.cloudapps.digital/dataset/d409b2ba-796c-4436-82c7-eb1831a9ef25/2019-waste-data-interrogator), [2020](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/bb40d091-a346-4b75-aa54-df7d347bed93/2020-waste-data-interrogator) and [2021]([2021](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/d8a12b93-03ef-4fbf-9a43-1ca7a054479c/2021-waste-data-interrogator) that has been produced by the Environment Agency is the primary data source for the report, together with other data Defra published as part of the Waste Management Statistics and information from the Waste Data Flow system, which can be found under [ENV18 - Local Authority Collected Waste](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/env18-local-authority-collected-waste-annual-results-tables). Additionally,[Remaining Landfill Capacity 2019-2021](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/237825cb-dc10-4c53-8446-1bcd35614c12/remaining-landfill-capacity) reported by the Environment Agency is also used.

# Waste Managed in Suffolk

The total amount of Local Authority Collected Waste in Suffolk (LACW) has reduced in the year 2020-21 as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:totallocalauthority):

```{r totallocalauthority,  fig.alig = "center", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, fig.cap = "\\label{fig:totallocalauthority}Source: [ENV18 - Local Authority Collected Waste](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/env18-local-authority-collected-waste-annual-results-tables)"}

p1 <- scc_barchart(
  lacw_scc,
  lacw_scc$`Financial Year`,
  lacw_scc$`Total local authority collected waste (tonnes)`,
  "Total local authority collected waste (tonnes)"
)

p1
```

Household waste arising has also reduced over this period, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:householdwaste)

This is slightly surprising in the context of the Covid 19 pandemic which required the majority of people to work from home.

However, consumption overall may have reduced as a result of lower economic activity during this period.

```{r householdwaste, fig.alig = "center", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, fig.cap = "Source: [ENV18 - Local Authority Collected Waste](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/env18-local-authority-collected-waste-annual-results-tables)"}
p2 <- scc_barchart(
  lacw_scc,
  lacw_scc$`Financial Year`,
  lacw_scc$`Household - total waste (tonnes)`,
  "Household - total waste (tonnes)"
)

p2
```

## Recycling Rates

The amount of LACW sent for recycling has steadily reduced over the last five years, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:sentforrecycling).

```{r sentforrecycling, fig.alig = "center", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, fig.cap = "Source: [ENV18 - Local Authority Collected Waste](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/env18-local-authority-collected-waste-annual-results-tables)"}
p3 <- scc_barchart(
  lacw_scc,
  lacw_scc$`Financial Year`,
  lacw_scc$`Household - waste sent for recycling-composting-reuse (tonnes)`,
  "Household - waste sent for recycling-composting-reuse (tonnes)"
)

p3
```

Suffolk historically had one of the highest recycling rates in England but this has reduced in all the Suffolk Districts over the past six years as shown in Table \@ref(tab:recyclingrates)

```{r recyclingrates, ft.align = "center", tab.id = "recyclingrates", label = "recyclingrates", tab.cap = "Source: [ENV18 - Local Authority Collected Waste](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/env18-local-authority-collected-waste-annual-results-tables)"}

recycling_rates <- lacw_scc %>%
  mutate(recycling_rates = round((`Local authority collected waste - sent for recycling-composting-reuse (tonnes)` / `Total local authority collected waste (tonnes)`* 100), 1)) %>%
  select(`Financial Year`, recycling_rates)

colnames(recycling_rates) <- c("Financial Year", "% sent for recycling")

recycling_rates %>%
  flextable() %>%
  set_table_properties(layout = "autofit") %>%
  theme_vanilla()
```

The LACW recycling rate is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:districtrecyclingratedistricts) for each of the Suffolk Districts.
These have been subject to some reorganisaition in recent years and so the graphs below show the rates for the combines councils before each merger and the current district.
It is possible that the process of re-organisation has disrupted services to some extent.

From 2019 - 20 Suffolk Coastal District Council and Waveney District Council merge to become East Suffolk Council, and Forest Heath District Council and St Edmundsbury Borough Council merged to become "West Suffolk Council".
Their figures have been aggregated in their respective Councils.

```{r districtrecyclingratedistricts, message = FALSE, fig.alig = "center", fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8, fig.cap = "Source: [ENV18 - Local Authority Collected Waste](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/env18-local-authority-collected-waste-annual-results-tables)"}
district_plot <- lapply(unique(lacw_suffolk$`Local Authority`), function(authority) {
  district_council <- lacw_suffolk %>%
    filter(`Local Authority` == authority)
  
  recycling_rates <- district_council %>%
    mutate(recycling_rates = (`Local authority collected waste - sent for recycling-composting-reuse (tonnes)` / `Total local authority collected waste (tonnes)`) * 100) %>%
    select(`Financial Year`, recycling_rates)
  
  colnames(recycling_rates) <- c("Financial Year", "% sent for recycling")

    recycling_rates,
    recycling_rates$`Financial Year`,
    recycling_rates$`% sent for recycling`,
    authority
  )
  
  p4
})

do.call(grid.arrange, c(district_plot, ncol = 1, top = "Recycling rate by district council"))
```

# Waste Capacity

## Waste Treatment

The capacity of waste management infrastructure has been calculated using the throughput of the facilities in the Plan Area as recorded in the Waste Data Interrogator.
Shown in Table \@ref(tab:wastecapacity) The amount of waste managed in all facilities in Suffolk increased from 2019 to 2020 and in particular the amount of waste managed at the Energy from Waste facility at Great Blakenham increased following the grant of planning permission to enable it to manage 295,000 tonnes per annum, an increase from the original capacity of 269,000 tonnes per annum.

**TZ: In version 4 (as per 05/22) of the 2020 WDI, geographical descriptors have been removed from mobile plant permits. Suffolk totals can therefore not be calculated for 2020. For that reason I have also left 2019 out, to allow for comparison.**

```{r wastecapacity, ft.align = "center", tab.id = "wastecapacity", label = "wastecapacity", tab.cap = "Source: [Waste Data Interrogator 2019](https://find-data-beta.cloudapps.digital/dataset/d409b2ba-796c-4436-82c7-eb1831a9ef25/2019-waste-data-interrogator), [2020](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/bb40d091-a346-4b75-aa54-df7d347bed93/2020-waste-data-interrogator) and [2021](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/d8a12b93-03ef-4fbf-9a43-1ca7a054479c/2021-waste-data-interrogator)."}

## Waste to Landfill

Figure \@ref(fig:wastetolandfill) shows active Landfill sites.
There is only one active landfill site receiving non-hazardous waste in Suffolk and this is Masons Landfill site which is operated by Viridor.
**TZ: This doesn't seem relevant anymore, see Folly Farm**

Worlington Quarry operated by Frimstone received significant amounts of soil deposits in 2020, but does not have a permit for the land filling of non-hazardous waste.
Its Permit is category A25 : Deposit of waste to land as a recovery operation.
**TZ: Not included as a landfill site in WDI**

Shrublands Quarry, an inert landfill site operated by Brett Aggregates also received significant quantities of inert waste in 2019.

Suffolk largely achieves the goal of net self-sufficiency in the management of the waste arising within its area.
This is demonstrated by the fact that there was a net flow of waste into Suffolk of **`r totals_formatting(from_others$"2019" - export_totals$"2019")` tonnes** in 2019, a net flow into the county of **`r totals_formatting(from_others$"2020" - export_totals$"2020")` tonnes** in 2020 and a net flow out of the county of **`r totals_formatting(export_totals$"2021" - from_others$"2021")` tonnes** This includes non-hazardous and inert wastes.
The net flow is calculated by taking the "Total waste managed origin outwith Suffolk" in Table \@ref(tab:tab1), and subtracting the "Sent from Suffolk total" in Table \@ref(tab:tab3)

## Waste Water Treatment

Of the tonnages sent from Suffolk to Norfolk, a large proportion comprised sludge which was sent to facilities managed by Anglian Water, as highlighted in Table \@ref(tab:tab4).

In 2019, `r totals_formatting(aw2019)` tonnes of sludges were sent to Whitlingham Sludge Treatment Centre, Thetford Sludge Treatment Centre and King's Lynn Sludge Treatment Centre in Norfolk by Anglian Water.
In 2020, `r totals_formatting(aw2020)` tonnes of sludges were sent to these facilities, and `r totals_formatting(aw2021)` in 2021.

Although in 2020 the total nearly halved, the reduction 2021 has slowed.
This implies that there is still a shortage of waste water treatment capacity in Suffolk and discussions with the Anglian Water would be useful to identify their needs to enable Suffolk to become more self-sufficient in managing this waste stream.

One remarkable rise from 2020 to 2021, is the increase in tonnage sent to Thetford Power Station, operated by EPR Thetford Limited.
This waste falls under SOC Category "09 - Animal and vegetable wastes" and SOC Sub Category "Slurry and manure", the waste is described as "animal faeces, urine and manure (including spoiled straw), effluent, collected separately and treated off-site".
Thetford Power Station is an Animal By-Products Incinerator, [which converts poultry litter into electricity](https://www.mreuk.com/thetford).

# Performance of the Waste Policies and Conclusions

The outcome of the waste planning process in Suffolk has been to deliver broadly sufficient capacity of waste management facilities to manage the waste arising within the County.This includes a wide variety of treatment facilities to manage different types of materials, an energy from waste facility to manage residual waste from household, commercial and industrial sources, and sufficient landfill to dispose of the remainder.

Efforts to reduce, reuse and recycle waste will continue, particularly in the context of the implementation of the Government's Resources and Waste Strategy which was published in 2018.
This proposes more separate collection of food waste and the separate collection of other easily recyclable materials and so consideration will need to be given to the delivery of bulking and transfer stations that may be associated with this.

Consideration may need to be given to the development of additional waste water treatment capacity, given the significant movements of sludges out of the Plan Area and liaison with Anglian Water will be needed to take this forward.
